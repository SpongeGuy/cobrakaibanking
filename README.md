## Description


We will be creating a lightweight banking simulation system that will manage new and existing users, account transactions and balances. The system will have the capability to store multiple accounts and track payments, deposits, and withdrawals and will also simulate interest given over time. The system will make use of a GUI to enable management of banking transactions and accounts.  Users will interact with a GUI to interface with our system. Users will be able to have multiple accounts which can all store money, support transactions, and generate interest. We decided on this type of system because it sounded like an interesting challenge and building this simulation will enhance our knowledge of how banks can keep track of their customers' money, transactions, and personal information along with keeping it all secure. This project will be streamlined and straightforward, but itâ€™ll be a challenge as well.
